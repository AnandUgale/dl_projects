Hello Friends

I want to show you a quick implementation of tensorflow library for MNIST dataset. I haven't use any tf.contrib (i.e tf.estimator, tf.keras, tf.layers etc)

It's a simple implementation for MNIST for those who wants to know how CNN implement without keras or estimators in tensorflow

Note : I recommended to use google's colab for GPU support. It will provide upto 10GB support for computing
